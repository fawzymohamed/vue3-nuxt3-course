# 🎯 Why Choose Vue?

::

::content-section

Vue.js is designed to be **incrementally adoptable**. You can use it to enhance existing projects or build new ones from scratch. Its **reactivity system** makes it easy to manage state and create dynamic interfaces.

::

::code-example

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";

const count = ref(0);
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="count++">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

::

**Key Insight**: Vue combines the best parts of other frameworks - the template syntax from Angular and the reactivity system and component-based architecture similar to React, but with a more approachable API.
