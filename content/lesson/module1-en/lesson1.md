# What is Vue.js? Why Vue?

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.

## What makes Vue special?

- **Approachable**: Familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript is all you need to get started
- **Versatile**: Powers everything from small interactive parts of a website to full single-page applications
- **Performant**: ~20KB min+gzip, blazing fast virtual DOM
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns while still being easy to understand

## The Vue Ecosystem

Vue is more than just a framework - it's a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries:

- **Vue Router**: Official router for Vue.js
- **Pinia**: State management library
- **Vue CLI / Vite**: Development tooling
- **Vue Devtools**: Browser extension for debugging

## Why Choose Vue?

### Developer Experience (DX)

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from "vue";

const count = ref(0);
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="count++">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

Vue combines the best parts of other frameworks - the template syntax from Angular and the reactivity system and component-based architecture similar to React, but with a more approachable API.
